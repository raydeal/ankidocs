<h1>Writing Anki 2.1.x Add-ons</h1>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

= Other Versions =

This document covers add-on writing for Anki 2.1.x. For instructions on
writing add-ons for Anki 2.0.x, please see
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons20.html

= Translations =

 * 日本語: http://rs.luminousspice.com/ankiaddons21/

= Overview =

Anki is written in a user-friendly language called Python. If you're not
familiar with Python, please read the http://docs.python.org/tutorial/[Python
tutorial] before proceeding with the rest of this document.

Because Python is a dynamic language, add-ons are extremely powerful in Anki -
not only can they extend the program, but they can also modify arbitrary
aspects of it, such as altering the way scheduling works, modifying the UI,
and so on.

No special development environment is required to develop add-ons. All you
need is a text editor. If you're on Windows or a Mac, please use the packaged
version of Anki that's provided on the website, as there are no instructions
available for building it from scratch on those platforms.

While you can write plugins in a simple text editor like notepad, you may want
to look into an editor that can provide syntax highlighting (colouring of the
code) to make things easier.

Anki is comprised of two parts: 

'anki' contains all the "backend" code - opening collections, fetching and
answering cards, and so on. It is used by Anki's GUI, and can also be included
in command line programs to access Anki decks without the GUI.

'aqt' contains the UI part of Anki. Anki's UI is built upon PyQt, Python
bindings for the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt. PyQt follows Qt's API very
closely, so the documentation can be very useful when you want to know how to
use a particular GUI component.

Anki 2.1.x uses http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/index.html[Qt 5.9]

When Anki starts up, it checks for modules in the add-ons folder, and runs
each one it finds. When add-ons are run, they typically modify existing code
or add new menu items to provide a new feature.

= Support =

This document contains some hints to get you started, but it is not a
comprehensive guide. To actually write an add-on, you will need to familiarize
yourself with Anki's source code, and the source code of other add-ons that do
similiar things to what you are trying to accomplish.

Because of our limited resources, *no official support is available for add-on
writing*. If you have any questions, you will either need to find the answers
yourself in the source code, or post your questions on the
https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons[community-supported add-on forum].

You can also use the add-on forum to request someone write an add-on for you.
You may need to offer some money before anyone becomes interested in helping you.

= Add-on folders =

You can access the top level add-ons folder by going to the Tools>Add-ons menu
item in the main Anki window. Click on the View Files button, and a folder
will pop up. If you had no add-ons installed, the top level add-ons folder
will be shown. If you had an add-on selected, the add-on's module folder will
be shown, and you will need to go up one level.

The add-ons folder is named "addons21", corresponding to Anki 2.1. If you have
an "addons" folder, it is because you have previously used Anki 2.0.x.

Each add-on uses one folder inside the add-on folder. Anki looks for a
file called `__init__.py` file inside the folder, eg:

  addons21/my_addon/__init__.py

If `__init__.py` does not exist, Anki will ignore the folder.

When choosing a folder name, it is recommended to stick to a-z and 0-9
characters to avoid problems with Python's module system.

While you can use whatever folder name you wish for folders you create
yourself, when you download an add-on from AnkiWeb, Anki will use the item's
ID as the folder name, such as:

 addons21/48927303923/__init__.py

Anki will also place a meta.json file in the folder, which keeps track of the
original add-on name, when it was downloaded, and whether it's enabled or not.

You should not store user data in the add-on folder, as it's
<<configuration,deleted when the user upgrades an add-on>>.

= A Simple Add-On =

Add the following to `my_first_addon/__init__.py` in your add-ons folder:

-----
# import the main window object (mw) from aqt
from aqt import mw
# import the "show info" tool from utils.py
from aqt.utils import showInfo
# import all of the Qt GUI library
from aqt.qt import *

# We're going to add a menu item below. First we want to create a function to
# be called when the menu item is activated.

def testFunction():
    # get the number of cards in the current collection, which is stored in
    # the main window
    cardCount = mw.col.cardCount()
    # show a message box
    showInfo("Card count: %d" % cardCount)

# create a new menu item, "test"
action = QAction("test", mw)
# set it to call testFunction when it's clicked
action.triggered.connect(testFunction)
# and add it to the tools menu
mw.form.menuTools.addAction(action)
-----

Restart Anki, and you should find a 'test' item in the tools menu. Running it
will display a dialog with the card count.

If you make a mistake when entering in the plugin, Anki will show an error
message on startup indicating where the problem is.

= The Collection =

All operations on a collection file are accessed via mw.col. Some basic
examples of what you can do follow. Please note that you should put these in
testFunction() as above. You can't run them directly in an add-on, as add-ons
are initialized during Anki startup, before any collection or profile has been
loaded.

*Get a due card:*

-----
card = mw.col.sched.getCard()
if not card:
    # current deck is finished
-----

*Answer the card:*

-----
mw.col.sched.answerCard(card, ease)
-----

*Edit a note (append " new" to the end of each field):*

-----
note = card.note()
for (name, value) in note.items():
    note[name] = value + " new"
note.flush()
-----

*Get card IDs for notes with tag x:*

-----
ids = mw.col.findCards("tag:x")
-----

*Get question and answer for each of those ids:*

-----
for id in ids:
    card = mw.col.getCard(id)    
    question = card.q()
    answer = card.a()
-----

*Reset the scheduler after any DB changes. Note that we call reset() on the
main window, since the GUI has to be updated as well:*

-----
mw.reset()
-----

*Import a text file into the collection*

-----
from anki.importing import TextImporter
file = u"/path/to/text.txt"
# select deck
did = mw.col.decks.id("ImportDeck")
mw.col.decks.select(did)
# anki defaults to the last note type used in the selected deck
m = mw.col.models.byName("Basic")
deck = mw.col.decks.get(did)
deck['mid'] = m['id']
mw.col.decks.save(deck)
# and puts cards in the last deck used by the note type
m['did'] = did
# import into the collection
ti = TextImporter(mw.col, file)
ti.initMapping()
ti.run()
-----
    
Almost every GUI operation has an associated function in anki, so any of
the operations that Anki makes available can also be called in an add-on.

If you want to access the collection outside of the GUI, you can do so with
the following code:

-----
from anki import Collection
col = Collection("/path/to/collection.anki2")
-----

If you make any modifications to the collection outside of Anki,
you must make sure to call col.close() when you're done,
or those changes will be lost.

= The Database =

When you need to perform operations that are not already supported by anki,
you can access the database directly. Anki collections are stored in SQLite
files. Please see the http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html[SQLite documentation]
for more information.

Anki's DB object supports the following functions:

*execute() allows you to perform an insert or update operation. Use named
arguments with ?. eg:*

-----
mw.col.db.execute("update cards set ivl = ? where id = ?", newIvl, cardId)
-----

*executemany() allows you to perform bulk update or insert operations. For
large updates, this is much faster than calling execute() for each data point.
eg:*

-----
data = [[newIvl1, cardId1], [newIvl2, cardId2]]
mw.col.db.executemany(same_sql_as_above, data)
-----

*scalar() returns a single item:*

-----
showInfo("card count: %d" % mw.col.db.scalar("select count() from cards"))
-----

*list() returns a list of the first column in each row, eg [1, 2, 3]:*

-----
ids = mw.col.db.list("select id from cards limit 3")
-----

*all() returns a list of rows, where each row is a list:*

-----
ids_and_ivl = mw.col.db.all("select id, ivl from cards")
-----

*execute() can also be used to iterate over a result set without building an
intermediate list. eg:*

-----
for id, ivl in mw.col.db.execute("select id, ivl from cards limit 3"):
    showInfo("card id %d has ivl %d" % (id, ivl))
-----

Add-ons should never modify the schema of existing tables, as that may
break future versions of Anki.

If you need to store addon-specific data, consider using Anki's
<<configuration>> support.

If you need the data to sync across devices, small options can be stored
within mw.col.conf. Please don't store large amounts of data there, as
it's sent on every sync.

= Hooks =

Hooks have been added to a few parts of the code to make writing add-ons
easier. There are two types: 'hooks' take some arguments and return no value,
and 'filters' take a value and return it (perhaps modified).

A simple example of the former is in the leech handling. When the scheduler
(anki/sched.py) discovers a leech, it calls:

-----
runHook("leech", card)
-----

If you wished to perform a special operation when a leech was discovered, such
as moving the card to a "Difficult" deck, you could do it with the following
code:

-----
from anki.hooks import addHook
from aqt import mw

def onLeech(card):
    # can modify without .flush(), as scheduler will do it for us
    card.did = mw.col.decks.id("Difficult")
    # if the card was in a cram deck, we have to put back the original due
    # time and original deck
    card.odid = 0
    if card.odue:
        card.due = card.odue
        card.odue = 0

addHook("leech", onLeech)
-----

An example of a filter is in aqt/editor.py. The editor calls the
"editFocusLost" filter each time a field loses focus, so that add-ons can
apply changes to the note:

-----
if runFilter(
    "editFocusLost", False, self.note, self.currentField):
    # something updated the note; schedule reload
    def onUpdate():
        self.loadNote()
        self.checkValid()
    self.mw.progress.timer(100, onUpdate, False)
-----

Each filter in this example accepts three arguments: a modified flag, the
note, and the current field. If a filter makes no changes it returns the
modified flag the same as it received it; if it makes a change it returns
True. In this way, if any single add-on makes a change, the UI will reload the
note to show updates.

The Japanese Support add-on uses this hook to automatically generate one field
from another. A slightly simplified version is presented below:

-----
def onFocusLost(flag, n, fidx):
    from aqt import mw
    # japanese model?
    if "japanese" not in n.model()['name'].lower():
        return flag
    # have src and dst fields?
    for c, name in enumerate(mw.col.models.fieldNames(n.model())):
        for f in srcFields:
            if name == f:
                src = f
                srcIdx = c
        for f in dstFields:
            if name == f:
                dst = f
    if not src or not dst:
        return flag
    # dst field already filled?
    if n[dst]:
        return flag
    # event coming from src field?
    if fidx != srcIdx:
        return flag
    # grab source text
    srcTxt = mw.col.media.strip(n[src])
    if not srcTxt:
        return flag
    # update field
    try:
        n[dst] = mecab.reading(srcTxt)
    except Exception, e:
        mecab = None
        raise
    return True
    
addHook('editFocusLost', onFocusLost)
-----

The first argument of a filter is the argument that should be returned. In the
focus lost filter this is a flag, but in other cases it may be some other
object. For example, in anki/collection.py, _renderQA() calls the "mungeQA"
filter which contains the generated HTML for the front and back of cards.
latex.py uses this filter to convert text in LaTeX tags into images.

In Anki 2.1, a hook was added for adding buttons to the editor. It can be used
like so:

-----
from aqt.utils import showInfo
from anki.hooks import addHook

# cross out the currently selected text
def onStrike(editor):
    editor.web.eval("wrap('<del>', '</del>');")

def addMyButton(buttons, editor):
    editor._links['strike'] = onStrike
    return buttons + [editor._addButton(
        "iconname", # "/full/path/to/icon.png",
        "strike", # link name
        "tooltip")]

addHook("setupEditorButtons", addMyButton)
-----

= Monkey Patching and Method Wrapping =

If you want to modify a function that doesn't already have a hook, it's
possible to overwrite that function with a custom version instead. This is
sometimes referred to as 'monkey patching'.

In aqt/editor.py there is a function setupButtons() which creates the buttons
like bold, italics and so on that you see in the editor. Let's imagine you
want to add another button in your add-on.

WARNING: Anki 2.1 no longer uses setupButtons(). The code below is still
useful to understand how monkey patching works, but for adding buttons to the
editor please see the setupEditorButtons hook described in the previous
section.

The simplest way is to copy and paste the function from the Anki source code,
add your text to the bottom, and then overwrite the original, like so:

-----
from aqt.editor import Editor
    
def mySetupButtons(self):
    <copy & pasted code from original>
    <custom add-on code>
    
Editor.setupButtons = mySetupButtons
-----
    
This approach is fragile however, as if the original code is updated in a
future version of Anki, you would also have to update your add-on. A better
approach would be to save the original, and call it in our custom version:

-----
from aqt.editor import Editor
    
def mySetupButtons(self):
    origSetupButtons(self)
    <custom add-on code>
    
origSetupButtons = Editor.setupButtons
Editor.setupButtons = mySetupButtons
-----

Because this is a common operation, Anki provides a function called wrap()
which makes this a little more convenient. A real example:

-----
from anki.hooks import wrap
from aqt.editor import Editor
from aqt.utils import showInfo
    
def buttonPressed(self):
    showInfo("pressed " + `self`)    

def mySetupButtons(self):
    # - size=False tells Anki not to use a small button
    # - the lambda is necessary to pass the editor instance to the
    #   callback, as we're passing in a function rather than a bound
    #   method
    self._addButton("mybutton", lambda s=self: buttonPressed(self),
                    text="PressMe", size=False)
    
Editor.setupButtons = wrap(Editor.setupButtons, mySetupButtons)
-----

By default, wrap() runs your custom code after the original code. You can pass
a third argument, "before", to reverse this. If you need to run code both
before and after the original version, you can do so like so:

-----
from anki.hooks import wrap
from aqt.editor import Editor
    
def mySetupButtons(self, _old):
    <before code>
    ret = _old(self)
    <after code>
    return ret
    
Editor.setupButtons = wrap(Editor.setupButtons, mySetupButtons, "around")
-----

If you need to modify the middle of a function rather than run code before or
after it, there may a good argument for adding a hook to that function in the
original code. In these situations, please post on the support site and ask
for a hook to be added.

= Qt =

As mentioned in the overview, the Qt documentation is invaluable for learning
how to display different GUI widgets.

One particular thing to bear in mind is that objects are garbage collected in
Python, so if you do something like:

-----
def myfunc():
    widget = QWidget()
    widget.show()
-----

...then the widget will disappear as soon as the function exits. To prevent
this, assign top level widgets to an existing object, like:

-----
def myfunc():
    mw.myWidget = widget = QWidget()
    widget.show()
-----

This is often not required when you create a Qt object and give it an existing
object as the parent, as the parent will keep a reference to the object.

= Standard Modules =

Anki ships with only the standard modules necessary to run the program - a
full copy of Python is not included. For that reason, if you need to use a
standard module that is not included with Anki, you'll need to bundle it with
your add-on.

This only works with pure Python modules - modules that require C extensions
such as numpy are much more difficult to package, as you would need to compile
them for each of the operating systems Anki supports. If you're doing something
sophisticated, it would be easier to get your users to install a standalone
copy of Python instead.

[[configuration]]
= Configuration =

If you include a config.json file with a JSON dictionary in it, Anki will
allow users to edit it from the add-on manager.

A simple example: in config.json:

   {"myvar": 5}

In config.md:

  This is documentation for this add-on's configuration, in *markdown* format.

In your add-on's code:

    from aqt import mw
    config = mw.addonManager.getConfig(__name__)
    print("var is", config['myvar'])

When updating your add-on, you can make changes to config.json. Any newly
added keys will be merged with the existing configuration.

If you change the value of existing keys in config.json, users who have
customized their configuration will continue to see the old values unless they
use the "restore defaults" button.

If you need to programmatically modify the config, you can save your changes with:

    mw.addonManager.writeConfig(__name__, config)

NOTE: If no config.json file exists, getConfig() will return None - even if you have
called writeConfig().

Add-ons that manage options in their own GUI can have that GUI
displayed when the config button is clicked:

    mw.addonManager.setConfigAction(__name__, myOptionsFunc)

Avoid key names starting with an underscore - they are reserved for future use
by Anki.

[[userfiles]]
= User Files =

When your add-on needs configuration data other than simple keys and values,
it can use a special folder called user_files in the root of your add-on's
folder. Any files placed in this folder will be preserved when the add-on is
upgraded. All other files in the add-on folder are removed on upgrade.

To ensure the user_files folder is created for the user, you can put a
README.txt or similar file inside it before zipping up your add-on.

When Anki upgrades an add-on, it will ignore any files in the .zip that
already exist in the user_files folder.

[[reviewjs]]
= Javascript in the question and answer =

(coming in 2.1.0beta16)

Anki provides a hook to modify the question and answer HTML before it is
displayed in the review screen, preview dialog, and card layout screen. This
can be useful for adding Javascript to the card.

An example:

    from anki.hooks import addHook
    def prepare(html, card, context):
        return html + """
    <script>
    document.body.style.background = "blue";
    </script>"""
    addHook('prepareQA', prepare)

The hook takes three arguments: the HTML of the question or answer, the
current card object (so you can limit your add-on to specific note types for
example), and a string representing the context the hook is running in.

Make sure you return the modified HTML.

Context is one of: "reviewQuestion", "reviewAnswer", "clayoutQuestion",
"clayoutAnswer", "previewQuestion" or "previewAnswer".

NOTE: The answer preview in the card layout screen, and the previewer set to
"show both sides" will only use the "Answer" context. This means Javascript
you append on the back side of the card should not depend on Javascript that
is only added on the front.

Because Anki fades the previous text out before revealing the new text,
Javascript hooks are required to perform actions like scrolling at the correct
time. You can use them like so:

    from anki.hooks import addHook
    def prepare(html, card, context):
        return html + """
    <script>
    onUpdateHook.push(function () {
        window.scrollTo(0, 2000);
    })
    </script>"""
    addHook('prepareQA', prepare)

- onUpdateHook fires after the new card has been placed in the DOM, but before
it is shown.
- onShownHook fires after the card has faded in.

The hooks are reset each time the question or answer is shown.

= Debugging =

If your code throws an exception, it will be caught by Anki's standard
exception handler (which catches anything written to stderr). If you need to
print information for debugging purposes, you can use aqt.utils.showInfo, or
write it to stderr with sys.stderr.write("text\n").

Anki also includes a REPL. From within the program, press the https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#debug-console[shortcut key]
and a window will open up. You can enter expressions or statements into the
top area, and then press ctrl+return/command+return to evaluate them. An
example session follows:

-----
>>> mw
<no output>

>>> print(mw)
<aqt.main.AnkiQt object at 0x10c0ddc20>

>>> invalidName
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/dae/Lib/anki/qt/aqt/main.py", line 933, in onDebugRet
    exec text
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'invalidName' is not defined

>>> a = [a for a in dir(mw.form) if a.startswith("action")]
... print(a)
... print()
... pp(a)
['actionAbout', 'actionCheckMediaDatabase', ...]

['actionAbout',
 'actionCheckMediaDatabase',
 'actionDocumentation',
 'actionDonate',
 ...]

>>> pp(mw.reviewer.card)
<anki.cards.Card object at 0x112181150>

>>> pp(card()) # shortcut for mw.reviewer.card.__dict__
{'_note': <anki.notes.Note object at 0x11221da90>,
 '_qa': [...]
 'col': <anki.collection._Collection object at 0x1122415d0>,
 'data': u'',
 'did': 1,
 'due': -1,
 'factor': 2350,
 'flags': 0,
 'id': 1307820012852L,
 [...]
}

>>> pp(bcard()) # shortcut for selected card in browser
<as above>
-----

Note that you need to explicitly print an expression in order to see what it
evaluates to. Anki exports pp() (pretty print) in the scope to make it easier
to quickly dump the details of objects, and the shortcut ctrl+shift+return
will wrap the current text in the upper area with pp() and execute the result.

If you're on Linux or are running Anki from source, it's also possible to
debug your script with pdb. Place the following line somewhere in your code,
and when Anki reaches that point it will kick into the debugger in the
terminal:

-----
from aqt.qt import debug; debug()
-----

Alternatively you can export DEBUG=1 in your shell and it will kick into the
debugger on an uncaught exception.

= Learning More =

Anki's source code is available at http://github.com/dae/. The
colllection object is defined in anki's collection.py. Other useful files
to check out are cards.py, notes.py, sched.py, models.py and decks.py.

It can also be helpful to look in the aqt source to see how it's calling
anki for a particular operation, or to learn more about the GUI.

Much of the GUI is defined in designer files. You can use the Qt Designer
program to open the .ui files and browse the GUI in a convenient way. 

And finally, it can also be extremely helpful to browse other add-ons to see
how they accomplish something.

[[sharing]]
= Sharing Add-ons =

== Sharing via AnkiWeb ==

You can package up an add-on for distribution by zipping it up, and giving
it a name ending in .ankiaddon.

The top level folder should not be included in the zip file. For example, if
you have a module like the following:

  addons21/myaddon/__init__.py
  addons21/myaddon/my.data

Then the zip file contents should be:

  __init__.py
  my.data

If you include the folder name in the zip like the following, AnkiWeb will not
accept the zip file:

 myaddon/__init__.py
 myaddon/my.data

On Unix-based machines, you can create a properly-formed file with the following
command:

 $ cd myaddon && zip -r ../myaddon.ankiaddon *

Python automatically creates `__pycache__` folders when your add-on is run.
Please make sure you delete these prior to creating the zip file, as AnkiWeb
can not accept zip files that contain `__pycache__` folders.

Once you've created a .ankiaddon file, you can use the Upload button on
https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/ to share the add-on with others.

== Sharing outside AnkiWeb ==

If you wish to distribute .ankiaddon files outside of AnkiWeb, your add-on
folder needs to contain a 'manifest.json' file. The file should contain
at least two keys: 'package' specifies the folder name the add-on will be
stored in, and 'name' specifies the name that will be shown to the user. You
can optionally include a 'conflicts' key which is a list of other packages
that conflict with the add-on, and a 'mod' key which specifies when the add-on
was updated.

When Anki downloads add-ons from AnkiWeb, only the conflicts key is used
from the manifest.

= Porting Anki 2.0 add-ons =

Python 3
---------

Anki 2.1 requires Python 3.6 or later. After installing Python 3 on your
machine, you can use the 2to3 tool to automatically convert your existing
scripts to Python 3 code on a folder by folder basis, like:

  2to3-3.6 --output-dir=aqt3 -W -n aqt
  mv aqt aqt-old
  mv aqt3 aqt

Most simple code can be converted automatically, but there may be parts of the
code that you need to manually modify.

Qt5 / PyQt5
------------

The syntax for connecting signals and slots has changed in PyQt5. Recent PyQt4
versions support the new syntax as well, so the same syntax can be used for
both Anki 2.0 and 2.1 add-ons.

More info is available at
http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/new_style_signals_slots.html

One add-on author reported that the following tool was useful to automatically
convert the code:
https://github.com/rferrazz/pyqt4topyqt5

The Qt modules are in 'PyQt5' instead of 'PyQt4'. You can do a conditional
import, but an easier way is to import from aqt.qt - eg

  from aqt.qt import *

That will import all the Qt objects like QDialog without having to specify the
Qt version.

Single .py add-ons need their own folder
----------------------------------------

Each add-on is now stored in its own folder. If your add-on was previously
called `demo.py`, you'll need to create a `demo` folder with an `__init__.py` file.

If you don't care about 2.0 compatibility, you can just rename `demo.py` to
`demo/__init__.py`.

If you plan to support 2.0 with the same file, you can copy your original file
into the folder (`demo.py` -> `demo/demo.py`), and then import it relatively
by adding the following to `demo/__init__.py`:

    from . import demo

The folder needs to be zipped up when uploading to AnkiWeb. For more info,
please see <<sharing,sharing add-ons>>.

Folders are deleted when upgrading
-----------------------------------

When an add-on is upgraded, all files in the add-on folder are deleted. The
only exception is the special <<userfiles,user_files folder>>. If your add-on
requires more than simple key/value configuration, make sure you store the
associated files in the user_files folder, or they will be lost on upgrade.

Supporting both 2.0 and 2.1 in one codebase
--------------------------------------------

Most Python 3 code will run on Python 2 as well, so it is possible to update
your add-ons in such a way that they run on both Anki 2.0 and 2.1. Whether
this is worth it depends on the changes you need to make.

Most add-ons that affect the scheduler should require only minor changes to
work on 2.1. Add-ons that alter the behaviour of the reviewer, browser or
editor may require more work.

The most difficult part is the change from the unsupported QtWebKit to
QtWebEngine. If you do any non-trivial work with webviews, some work will be
required to port your code to Anki 2.1, and you may find it difficult to
support both Anki versions in the one codebase.

If you find your add-on runs without modification, or requires only minor
changes, you may find it easiest to add some if statements to your code and
upload the same file for both 2.0.x and 2.1.x.

If your add-on requires more significant changes, you may find it easier to
stop providing updates for 2.0.x, or to maintain separate files for the two
Anki versions.

Webview Changes
----------------

Qt 5 has dropped WebKit in favour of the Chromium-based WebEngine, so
Anki's webviews are now using WebEngine. Of note:

- You can now debug the webviews using an external Chrome instance, by setting
  the env var QTWEBENGINE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING to 8080 prior to starting Anki,
  then surfing to localhost:8080 in Chrome.
- WebEngine uses a different method of communicating back to Python.
  AnkiWebView() is a wrapper for webviews which provides a pycmd(str) function in
  Javascript which will call the ankiwebview's onBridgeCmd(str) method. Various
  parts of Anki's UI like reviewer.py and deckbrowser.py have had to be
  modified to use this.
- Javascript is evaluated asynchronously, so if you need the result of a JS
  expression you can use ankiwebview's evalWithCallback().
- As a result of this asynchronous behaviour, editor.saveNow() now requires a
  callback. If your add-on performs actions in the browser, you likely need to
  call editor.saveNow() first and then run the rest of your code in the callback.
  Calls to .onSearch() will need to be changed to .search()/.onSearchActivated()
  as well. See the browser's .deleteNotes() for an example.
- Various operations that were supported by WebKit like setScrollPosition() now
need to be implemented in javascript.
- Page actions like mw.web.triggerPageAction(QWebEnginePage.Copy) are also
asynchronous, and need to be rewritten to use javascript or a delay.
- WebEngine doesn't provide a keyPressEvent() like WebKit did, so the code
that catches shortcuts not attached to a menu or button has had to be changed.
setStateShortcuts() fires a hook that can be used to adjust the shortcuts for
a given state.

Reviewer Changes
----------------

Anki now fades the previous card out before fading the next card in, so the
next card won't be available in the DOM when the showQuestion hook fires.
There are some new hooks you can use to run Javascript at the appropriate time
- see <<reviewjs,here>> for more.

Add-on Configuration
--------------------

Many small 2.0 add-ons relied on users editing the sourcecode to customize them. This is no longer a good idea in 2.1, because changes made by the user will be overwritten when they check for and download updates. 2.1 provides a <<configuration>> system to work around this. If you need to continue supporting 2.0 as well, you could use code like the following:

  if getattr(getattr(mw, "addonManager", None), "getConfig", None):
      config = mw.addonManager.getConfig(__name__)
  else:
      config = dict(optionA=123, optionB=456)
