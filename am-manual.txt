AnkiMobile 2.0 User Manual
___________________________

= Help & Bugs =

There's a dedicated https://anki.tenderapp.com/[support site] for
questions, suggestions and bug reports.

= Introduction =

Thank you for buying AnkiMobile! Anki development would not be able to
continue without your support, so it is greatly appreciated.

As mentioned on the app store page, AnkiMobile is currently intended to be
used in conjunction with Anki on your computer. While it is possible to
download shared decks, study, and edit the content of your notes, certain
actions are currently only possible on the computer version. While this is
expected to change over time, for now please ensure you have access to a
computer in order to perform some of the operations mentioned below.

Some basic concepts covered in the
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html[computer manual] are not repeated
here, so please check it out if you have not already done so.

= Searching =

If you are looking for something in particular in this manual, most web
browsers will allow you to find particular words and phrases. 

*On a phone/iPad*, type the word you wish to search for in the location bar at
the top, and when a list of possible matches appears, choose the "Find on
page" option at the bottom to search through this page.

*On a computer*, choose Find from the Edit menu in most browsers.

= Privacy =

No data you store in AnkiMobile is shared with us or other Anki users by default. If you use
the optional synchronization feature, please see https://ankiweb.net/account/privacy[AnkiWeb's privacy policy].

[[adding]]
= Adding Decks =

To start using AnkiMobile, we need to add some cards to study. We can either
download card decks that other people have shared, or add existing decks from the
computer.

== Shared Decks ==

To download a shared deck directly to your mobile device:

 . Ensure you're connected to the internet.
 . Tap *Add/Export* on the bottom left.
 . Choose *Shared Deck List*. AnkiWeb will open.
 . Select a category, or type in a search.
 . Tap on a deck you'd like to study.
 . Scroll down and tap *Download*.
 . Safari will start downloading the file
 . When it's done, it will display a button near the top right
   labeled *Open in Anki*. Tap this button.
 . When the import completes, your deck should be ready to study.

Information on reviewing is available further below.

[[ankiweb]]
== Cloud Sync ==

Anki has a free cloud synchronization service called AnkiWeb that makes it
easy to keep your card decks in sync between mobile devices and your computer.

To sync with AnkiWeb, you'll first need to create an account. If you have used
AnkiWeb in the past, you can skip this step.

 . Visit https://ankiweb.net and click the *Sign Up* button.
 . Type in your email address and a password of your choice.

If you have decks on your computer and would like them to be synced to AnkiMobile:

 . Open the computer version and click the sync button at the top right of the Anki window.
 . If prompted to upload or download, choose 'upload' to send your cards to AnkiWeb.
 . Tap Synchronize in AnkiMobile and then 'download' to grab the cards from AnkiWeb.

If you have decks in your phone/iPad and would like them to be synced to the computer version:

 . Tap Synchronize in AnkiMobile and then 'upload' to send the cards to AnkiWeb.
 . Open the computer version and click the sync button at the top right of the Anki window.
 . If prompted to upload or download, choose 'download' to grab your cards from AnkiWeb.

If you have a lot of sounds or images on your cards, the first sync may take
some time.

After the first synchronization has completed, you can click the synchronize
button again any time you wish to synchronize your changes to the cloud. Only
changes made since the previous sync will be sent, so subsequent syncs are a
lot faster.

If you add some new cards on the desktop computer and want to sync them to
AnkiMobile, you'd repeat the same process: sync on desktop (or close the
program, as it syncs automatically on close by default), and then tap the sync
button on AnkiMobile.

== iTunes Import/Export ==

If you don't have regular internet access, it's still possible to copy decks
back and forth to your device, by using iTunes.

The iTunes import/export works by importing or exporting *all your decks at
once*, in a special file called collection.apkg or .colpkg. This means that
unlike syncing via AnkiWeb, you can't make changes from two locations at once
and then merge them - you need to make sure you've imported any recent changes
from your other device before you make changes, or you'll end up losing the
changes made on one device.

Thus the workflow you would typically use is to export your collection from
your mobile device and import it into the computer version, make modifications
(such as importing a shared deck you downloaded to your computer), and then
export your collection and import it back into your mobile device.

AnkiMobile can't directly import text files. If you wish to do that, you'll
need to do that with the computer program, and then import your collection into
AnkiMobile.

=== From computer to mobile device ===

On your computer:

 . Open the computer version of Anki.
 . Choose File>Export from the menu.

 . Click the 'Export...' button. Make sure to leave "all decks" selected, and
   "Include scheduling information" must also remain checked.
 . Anki will automatically create a collection.apkg or .colpkg file on your desktop. If the
   file is named something else like 'deckname.apkg', please see the previous step again.
 . Connect your Apple device to your computer via the USB cable, or wi-fi
if you have wi-fi syncing set up in iTunes.
 . Open iTunes if it doesn't open automatically.
 . Locate Anki's file sharing section with
   http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4094[Apple's instructions].
 . Drag the collection.apkg or .colpkg file from your desktop into iTunes.
 . Click the sync button inside iTunes.

Then in AnkiMobile, in the deck list screen:

 . Tap the Add/Export button on the bottom left.
 . Choose *Import from iTunes*, then confirm the replacement.
 . If you receive a message about "No file found to import", please read the "on
   the computer" section above again.

Once complete, the decks on your device will have been replaced with the decks
from your desktop.

When you import a collection.apkg or .colpkg file, Anki will avoid copying any
sounds or images if they already exist on your mobile device, and are the same
file size. This will make imports after the first one considerably faster if you
have a lot of media files.

=== From mobile device to computer ===

On AnkiMobile:

 . Tap the Add/Export button on the bottom left.
 . Choose *Export to iTunes*, and tap *Export*

Then on your computer:

 . Connect your Apple device to your computer via the USB cable.
 . Open iTunes if it doesn't open automatically.
 . Locate Anki's file sharing section with
   http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4094[Apple's instructions].
 . Drag the collection.apkg or .colpkg file from iTunes to your desktop.
 . If you're still using Anki 2.0 on your computer, rename the file to
   'collection.apkg'. This step is not required if you're using the Anki 2.1.
 . Use File>Import in Anki to import the file.
 . Confirm you wish to replace, so that the deck from your mobile device
   overwrites the old data on your desktop.
 . After importing, you can delete the file on your desktop if you wish.

= The Deck List =

The deck list is the screen you see when you start AnkiMobile. It displays a
list of your card decks, and provides buttons for performing various actions.

Next to each deck, two numbers are displayed. The top, green number
corresponds to how many cards are due to be reviewed again today. On a deck
you've never studied before, there won't be any cards waiting for review. The
second, blue number, corresponds to how many new cards you have to learn
today. Anki will introduce 20 new cards a day by default, and you can
customize this number in the deck options if you'd like.

To study cards in a deck, simply tap on the deck, and AnkiMobile will switch
to study mode.

If you wish to delete a deck, swipe your finger from right to left over it,
and a delete button will appear.

To rename a deck, hold your finger on a deck for about a second.

At the top of the screen, you'll see two buttons. The question mark opens
this help page, and the gear/cog button opens the AnkiMobile preferences
screen.

On the bottom of the screen, there are two more buttons. *Add/Export* allows
you to download shared decks, add/create an empty deck, and import/export
.apkg files from iTunes. *Synchronize* synchronizes your cards with the cloud.

The synchronize button will turn yellow if you have made changes that need to
be synchronized to AnkiWeb, or if changes are waiting on AnkiWeb that need to
be synchronized to the device. One of the changes that Anki synchronizes to
other clients is the current deck, so tapping on a deck will turn the
button yellow even if you do not study any cards.

= The Study Screen =

If you have not used Anki on a computer before, please have a look at the
first https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#_intro_videos[intro video]
before reading on, as it explains the basic review process.

When you tap on a deck in the deck list, the study screen will load, and if
any cards are waiting to be studied, a card's question will be shown to you.

If you wish to change to a different deck, you can do so by tapping the top
left button. The next three buttons allow you to add cards, edit the current
card, and search/browse all cards. The top right button will open up the
<<tools,tools screen>>, where you can modify deck options and access more card
actions.

On the bottom of the screen you'll see three numbers. From the left, these
correspond to new cards, learning cards, and cards to review. These are
explained in more detail in the intro videos for the desktop program, so
please https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#_intro_videos[check them out]
if you haven't already.

When you've looked at a card's question and remembered the answer, or decided
you don't know it, tap anywhere in the card area in order to show the answer.
When you do, the bottom area will change to display 2-4 answer buttons,
depending on how you've answered the card previously. The buttons will display
the time a card will next be shown, so 10m means "10 minutes" and "5d" means
"5 days". You can tap directly on these buttons to choose a particular answer.

To make reviewing faster, you can also tap on the card in order to answer it.
For more information on the available taps and how to customize them, please
see the <<taps,taps>> section.

If you are studying content for which it is useful to sketch something before
showing the answer on the card (e.g., characters in a foreign language),
AnkiMobile provides a feature called the 'scratchpad' (the analogous feature is
called the 'whiteboard' in AnkiDroid). You can enable the scratchpad by
adding the 'Toggle ScratchPad' <<actions,action>> to a <<taps,tap>>, swipe,
quickbar action, or tool button, or by tapping on the tools screen, then
choosing More and then Toggle ScratchPad. 

When you've finished the cards that are due to be studied today, you'll be
shown a congratulations message. If you have other decks, you can tap the top
left button to return to the decks list and select a different one. You can
tap the home button to close Anki and save your progress at any time, whether
you have completed the day's reviews or not.

If you wish to keep studying the same cards after the congratulations message
is displayed, please see the <<filtered,filtered deck>> section.

If you have a bluetooth keyboard, you can use the keyboard to review. Space
will show the answer or answer Good, and 1-4 will choose the answer buttons.
You can also press 'r' to repeat the audio on the current card.

[[tools]]
= The Tools Screen =

The tools screen will open when you tap on the top right button while
studying.

*Study Options* allows you to configure options related to the current deck,
such as the number of new cards and reviews to introduce each day. Which
options are show will depend on if the deck you have selected is a filtered
deck or a regular deck.

*Font Scale* allows you to increase or decrease the size of the text on cards
without modifying how they appear on a computer. It is not specific to a deck
- when changed, it changes all cards in all decks in the same way. For more
precise control over the appearance of cards, you can edit your card templates
in the computer version of Anki.

*Tool Buttons*: Please see the <<toolbuttons,tool buttons>> section.

[[studyopts]]
= Study Options =

The study options can be accessed from the <<tools,tools>> screen. Almost all
the options available in the computer version can also be adjusted in
AnkiMobile. For a description of what everything does, please see the
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#deckoptions[computer documentation]. While
some of the options have different wording, the behave the same as the
computer version.

= Preferences =

The preferences screen can be accessed by tapping on the gear icon at the top
right of the deck list. It allows you to customize various application
settings and how AnkiMobile appears.

The Preferences screen is divided up into different sections, which are
covered below.

== Syncing ==

The syncing screen allows you to customize cloud synchronization with AnkiWeb.
For more information on syncing with the cloud, please see <<ankiweb,this
section>>.

Sync Sounds & Images :: By default, AnkiMobile will sync sounds and images as well
as your cards and review history. If you disable this option, sounds and
images will not be synced by AnkiMobile.
Full Sync :: The full sync button allows you to force a full upload or
download of your cards. This is useful if you accidentally deleted some cards
and want to revert to the local or remote version, instead of having those
deletions propagate to other devices. After tapping the button, you'll be
given a choice of whether you want to upload your collection or download it from
AnkiWeb. Please note this option only affects how cards, notes and review
history is transferred - it does not change how sounds and images are synced.

== Review: General ==

The review screen allows you to customize how AnkiMobile behaves when you're
reviewing cards.

Scheduling, taps, swipes, tool buttons and quickbar are covered in their
own sections further below.

Force Orientation :: Allows you to force the reviewing screen to stay in
portrait mode or landscape mode.
Answer Buttons :: Allows you to hide the answer buttons at the bottom of the
screen, if you prefer to answer via taps/swipes.
Button Size :: Lets you control the size of the answer buttons.
Next Times :: By default, the answer buttons will display the time a card will
next be shown. If you disable this option, labels like "Again", "Good" and
"Easy" will be shown instead.
Remaining Count :: Allows you to hide the card count, while still showing the
answer buttons when the answer is shown.
Feedback Ticks :: Flash a tick or cross in the top right to confirm your
answer choice.
Audio Buttons :: Allows you to hide the play button that appears for each
audio file you've placed on the card. Useful if you'd rather replay audio via
the "Replay Audio" action bound to a swipe or tap.
Always Duck + Ignore Mute :: While AnkiMobile is running, any music that is
playing in other apps will be played at a reduced volume to make it easier to
hear the audio on your cards. When enabled, this option will also allow audio
to play automatically even when the mute/vibrate/silent switch is turned on.
Answer Keeps Zoom :: By default, if you have zoomed in on a card, the screen
will zoom out when you reveal the answer. If you enable this option,
AnkiMobile will not zoom out.
Never Type Answer :: If you have set up your cards to ask you to type in the
answer (as explained in https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#templates[this
section] of the desktop manual), AnkiMobile will display a keyboard on such
cards and allow you to check your answer. If you find typing on a mobile
device inconvenient, you can use this option to disable the keyboard for all
cards.
Shake Action :: Allows you to customize what happens when you shake your
device. The default action is to undo the previous answer.
Scratchpad Pen Size :: The size of the line drawn on the scratchpad.

[[scheduling]]
== Review: Scheduling Options ==

These options affect the way Anki schedules cards in all decks.

New/Review Order :: Whether Anki should introduce new cards before, after, or
together with review cards.
Day Starts :: Controls when a new day starts and new cards become available.
Default is 04:00, which means new cards become available at 4AM.
Learn Ahead Minutes :: The number of minutes to look ahead when the only cards
remaining to review with a next repetition time in the future. The default is
20 minutes, which means cards due to show in 10 minutes will be shown
immediately if nothing else is available to show.

[[actions]]
== Review: Actions ==

AnkiMobile allows you to customize the interface, so that actions you perform
frequently can be accomplished quickly. It's possible to assign actions to
taps, swipes, buttons on the top bar and buttons in the tools screen.

The following actions are available:

Add :: Opens a new window to add cards to the deck.

Answer "Again" :: When the answer screen is shown, choose the red
button, indicating you wish to review the card again soon. This is useful when
you forgot a card or wish to review it more frequently.

Answer "Hard" :: When the answer screen is shown and there are four buttons,
choose the second button from the left, indicating you found the card hard to
remember.

Answer "Good" :: When the answer screen is shown, choose the green button.
This is the button you should end up using the most.

Answer "Easy" :: When the answer screen is shown, choose the button on the
right, indicating you found the card too easy to remember and would like a
much longer delay.

Bury Card :: Hides the current card from review. It will be shown again
the next day, or when you manually unbury cards.

Bury Note :: Hides the current note from review. It will be shown again the
next day, or when you manually unbury cards.

Card Info :: Shows information about the current card.

Current Audio +5s :: Jump forward 5 seconds in the currently playing audio.

Current Audio -5s :: Jump backward 5 seconds in the currently playing audio.

Custom Study :: Allows you to study outside of the normal schedule. Please see
the documentation of the computer version for more information on custom study
presets.

Deck List :: Returns to the deck list.

Delete Note :: Deletes the currently shown note and all of its cards. If
you're not studying in multiple directions, this will just delete a single
card.

Edit :: Edits the current card.

Empty :: Removes all cards from the current filtered deck.

Filter/Cram:: Allows you to create a temporary deck based on search criteria such as
"tag:hard". Please see the documentation of the computer version for more
information on filtered decks.

Find:: Lets you search/browse your cards.

Forget :: Turn the current card back into a new card.

Mark :: Adds a tag called "Marked" the current note, so it can be easily found
in a search.

Mark & Bury :: Marks the card, then buries it.

Mark & Suspend :: Marks the card, then suspends it.

More :: Shows a list of all available actions.

Off :: Don't do anything. Useful if you want to disable certain swipes, tap
zones and so on.

Pause/Unpause Current Audio :: Temporarily stop or restart the currently playing audio file.

Rebuild :: When in a filtered or custom study deck, rerun the search to fetch
any cards that may newly match the criteria.

Replay Audio :: Replay the card's audio. You can customize whether the audio
in the question is replayed while the answer is shown in the computer Anki.

Set Due Date :: Make the card a review card if it is not already one,
and make it due in the number of days you specify. If you choose 0 days,
the card will be ready to review immediately.

Show Answer :: Reveals the answer when a card's question is shown.

Study Options :: Show the study options screen.

Suspend Card :: Prevent current card from being shown during review until you
unsuspend it via the search action.

Suspend Note:: Prevent all cards of current note from being shown during
review until you unsuspend them via the search action.

Toggle Nav. Bar :: Show or hide the status bar and navigation bar at the top.
If you've accidentally hidden the navigation bar, you can restore it by
swiping from the far right of the study screen towards the left, then tap on
More, then Toggle Nav. Bar.

Toggle Night Mode :: Show cards as white text on a black background. The
styling can be <<nightmode-styling,customized>> in the computer version. This
action requires AnkiMobile 2.0.36 or later.

Toggle ScratchPad :: Show or hide the writing pad, allowing you to
practice writing characters during review. Anki will remember the on/off state
for each card type. You can tap once on the undo button to undo a stroke, or
hold on it for a second to clear all strokes. On devices that support pressure
sensitivity (iPhone 6S, iPad w/ Apple Pencil), the stroke width will depend on
how hard you press.

Tools :: Show the tools screen.

Unbury Deck :: Makes any buried cards in the current deck ready for review
again.

Undo :: Undoes the last action.

[[taps]]
== Review: Taps ==

When you're reviewing, you can tap on different parts of a card in order to
trigger different actions.

Anki divides the screen into 9 sections:

[width="30%",cols="^.^1,^.^1,^.^1"]
|=====
|Top Left|Top Center|Top Right
|Mid Left|Mid Center|Mid Right
|Bottom Left|Bottom Center|Bottom Right
|=====

Each section can have a different action assigned to it if you wish, and the
taps when the question is shown are also different from the taps when the
answer is shown.

By default, AnkiMobile responds as follows when the question in shown:

[width="30%",cols="^.^1,^.^1,^.^1"]
|=====
|Show Answer|Show Answer|Show Answer
|Show Answer|Show Answer|Show Answer
|Show Answer|Show Answer|Show Answer
|=====

In other words, tapping anywhere on the screen will show the answer.

When the answer is shown, by default AnkiMobile responds as follows:

[width="30%",cols="^.^1,^.^1,^.^1"]
|=====
|Answer "Again"|Off|Answer "Good"
|Answer "Again"|Off|Answer "Good"
|Answer "Again"|Off|Answer "Good"
|=====

This allows you to tap on the left side of the screen to trigger the red
button, and the right side of the screen to trigger the green button. Taps
near the middle of the screen will be ignored.

=== Swipes ===

You can also swipe up, down, left or right across a card to trigger an action.

To ensure swipes don't interfere with your ability to scroll on a large card
or select text, a swipe must begin from the left or right side of the screen.
Begin by placing your finger on the left or right side of the screen, and then
move it up, down, left or right to trigger the relevant swipe.

With the default settings:

 * Swiping left displays the tools window
 * Swiping right returns to the deck list

[[toolbuttons]]
== Review: Tool Buttons ==

In the middle of the tools screen, AnkiMobile displays 8 buttons for commonly
used operations. By default, the actions are:

[width="30%",cols="^.^1,^.^1"]
|=====
|Mark|Delete Note
|Undo|Card Info
|Bury Note|Deck Statistics
|Custom Study|More
|=====

For descriptions of what each action does, please see the <<actions,action
descriptions>> above.

[[quickbar]]
== Review: Quickbar ==

When studying, the middle buttons at the top of the screen are called the
'quickbar'. By default they allow you to add cards, edit the current card,
and search/browse cards.

== Theme ==

The theme screen allows you to customize the colours AnkiMobile uses for the
interface: the buttons, background image and so on.

To customize the appearance of your cards, it's currently necessary to adjust
the appearance in the computer version and then sync or copy your cards over to
AnkiMobile. For more information, please see
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#templates[this section] of the computer
version's manual.

== Profiles ==

Profiles allow multiple users to study with the same device. You can add
profiles from the settings screen. To remove a profile, hold down on it
for a few seconds.

Each profile needs to be synced with its own AnkiWeb account. Please be careful
not to sync two profiles with the same AnkiWeb ID, as this could lead to data
loss.

== Backups ==

AnkiMobile will automatically create backups of your collection for
you. The backups include all your cards and statistics, but do not include
sounds or images, since they take up a lot of space.

The backup is taken in the background when you return to your device's home
screen, or switch to another app. A backup will only happen if more than an
hour has elapsed since the last time a backup was created. AnkiMobile will
store the last 15 backups.

To restore from a backup, open the Backups section in the preferences, and tap
on the backup you wish to restore to.

It is also possible to customize the frequency and amount of backups that are
created, via the settings at the top of the backups section. You can change 15
to a different number to adjust the number of backups - set it to zero to
disable backups completely.

If you're unable to get AnkiMobile to start due to a serious error, you can
still retrieve the backups from the iTunes file sharing area:

 . Connect your Apple device to your computer via the USB cable.
 . Open iTunes if it doesn't open automatically.
 . Locate Anki's file sharing section with
   http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4094[Apple's instructions].
 . Drag the your backup files from iTunes to your desktop.
 . With the computer version of Anki, create a new, empty profile via
   File>Switch Profile, and then File>Import the latest backup apkg from
   within that profile to confirm that it's ok. If it is corrupt, you can try
   a previous backup.

== Check Database ==

This will check your collection for a number of possible errors and fix them
if possible.

It also will remove any tags that are no longer used by any cards.

== Check Media ==

This scans all your notes for references to sounds and images, and then checks
to make sure that the sounds and images are available. It will display a
report letting you know of any sounds or images that are missing, and any
sounds or images that are not used by any cards. If you tap the delete button,
the unused sounds or images will be deleted.

= Adding Material  =

To add cards to a deck, tap the "Add" button while reviewing.

The "Type" button at the top allows you to select the type of note you'd like
to add. For more information about note types, please see the introduction in
the https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#basics[computer version's manual].

When you tap on a field, a keyboard will come up, allowing you to type in
information. You can use the next and previous buttons to move between fields,
and the done button to hide the keyboard.

The camera icon allows you to add an image to your note, either via your
device's camera (if it has one), or from your photo library. The microphone
icon allows you to record your voice and place it into a field.

When you've typed in the content of a note, hit the save button to add it to
your collection.

The magnifying glass at the bottom allows you to see a preview of the card(s)
which would be added. You'll need to hide the keyboard to make the icon
visible.

= Editing =

To edit a note, tap the "Edit" button while reviewing.

The edit screen is similar to the adding screen mentioned above, with some key
differences:

 * There is no note type selection button or deck selection button. If you
   want to change the type of an existing note or which deck it's in, you
   currently need to do so with the computer version of Anki.
 * There is a "Tools" button at the top of the screen. Tapping on it will allow you to perform actions on the current card or note.
   Please see the <<actions,action descriptions>> for more information on what each
   action does.

= Finding/Searching/Browsing =

You can search or browse your deck by tapping the "Find" button while
reviewing.

The find screen starts by displaying a search bar with the text:
`deck:current`, and displaying the keyboard. If you tap the return button on
the keyboard, AnkiMobile will display all cards in the current deck.

You can type text into the search box in order to limit the cards further. If
you only wanted to show cards in the current deck that contain the text
"hello" for example, you'd modify the text so it says `deck:current hello` and
then tap return. If you wish to search across multiple decks, you can remove
the `deck:current` part.

AnkiMobile supports all the search strings that the desktop version of Anki
does, allowing you to perform quite complex searches. Some examples:

 tag:marked :: show cards that with the tag "marked"
 is:due :: show only cards that are waiting for review
 front:rabbit :: show only cards where the front field is exactly "rabbit"

For a full list of the possibilities, please see the section in the
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#searching[desktop manual].

When a search returns one or more cards, you can tap on a card to edit it, or
perform various actions like previewing it, deleting it, showing information
about it, and so on.

Cards that are matched in a search will show all the note text, with the card
template's name at the front, like "[Front] first field; second field".

[[filtered]]
= Filtered Decks =

Anki is designed to optimize the learning process, so that you study the
minimum amount necessary to remember the majority of your cards. Once the
congratulations screen is reached, further study becomes a case of diminishing
returns: the amount of extra time spent going over the same cards again is
generally not worth the moderate increase in retention you'll see.

That said, if you have a test looming, or simply want to pass some time, it's
possible to keep reviewing once the congratulations screen is reached.

A 'filtered deck' is a temporary deck that contains cards based on various
criteria, such as "forgotten today", "is tagged 'hard'", and so on. After
studying cards in a filtered deck, or when the filtered deck is deleted, the
cards are automatically returned to their original deck.

The easiest way to create a filtered deck is by using the "custom study"
feature. A custom study link will appear when you've finished all waiting
cards in a deck. You can also access custom study ahead of time by clicking
the tools button, and then choosing "Custom Study".

Advanced users can create a filtered deck manually, by clicking the tools
button, then choosing "More" and then "Filter/Cram".

For further information on filtered decks, please see the
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#filtered[computer version's documentation].

= Advanced Features =

== Custom Fonts ==

AnkiMobile allows you to use non-system fonts on your cards. To set them up,
the desktop client is required. Please see
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#installingfonts[the section in the desktop

Please note that AnkiMobile has to load the entire font into memory in order
to use it, and fonts for Asian languages can be quite large. If you have an
older device and notice AnkiMobile crashing frequently after installing a
font, you may have exceeded your device's memory limits.

[[nightmode-styling]]
== Night Mode Styling ==

By using the Edit Card Template action, it is possible to customize how cards
appear when night mode is enabled.

If you wanted a grey background instead of black, you could use something like:

-----
.card.nightMode { background-color: #555; }
-----

If you have a 'myclass' style, the following would show the text in yellow when night mode is enabled:

-----
.nightMode .myclass { color: yellow; }
-----

== URL schemes ==

AnkiMobile supports URL schemes for opening third party dictionaries, and for
adding content to AnkiMobile from other applications.

=== AnkiMobile's URL Scheme ===

A 'URL Scheme' is like a link to a website, but it instead links to an app. A
simple example is:

  anki://

If you type this into Safari on your device, you'll see AnkiMobile open up.

From 2.0.30 onwards, AnkiMobile provides a scheme for adding new notes to your
collection. This can be used with dictionary apps that support calling other
apps via URL schemes, and with automation apps like Workflow.

The scheme to add cards looks like this:

  anki://x-callback-url/addnote?profile=User 1&type=Basic&deck=Default&fldFront=front text&fldBack=back text

The first part must always be there:

anki://x-callback-url/addnote?

After the first part, keys and values are separated by an ampersand. The
following keys must always be provided:

- profile=<profile name>
- type=<note type name>
- deck=<deck name>

Fields are entered by prefixing their name with "fld". So if your first field
is called "Text", the key would be "fldText". The field text is interpreted as
HTML, so if you wanted a newline in the text you'd use something like "line
1<br>line 2".

Special characters in the URL must be escaped. For example, if you have spaces
in a field, they must be represented with `%20`. If you're using the
Shortcuts app, there is a URL encode action which you may find useful.

The remaining keys are optional:

- tags=<tags separated by space>
- dupes=1 - if provided, allow a note to be added even if the same content is on an existing note.
- x-success=<url scheme for another app> - use to automatically return to another app after the note is added.

If a field you provide is a link to an image or audio file, AnkiMobile will automatically download that media and place a link to it in the field. Eg:

 fldFront=http://example.com/image.jpg

The link will only be downloaded if it ends with a recognized file extension.
If your link is to a dynamic webpage, you can add a fake argument with the
extension at the end, eg
http://example.com/getImage?imgID=1234&fakePath=foo.jpg. Be careful to escape
the URL before including it in the URL scheme, as otherwise ? and & characters
will be interpreted as part of the URL scheme instead of the URL.

=== Dictionary Links ===

The desktop version of Anki provides the ability to open a web page based on
the contents of a field, for easily creating a link to an online dictionary
site. This is documented
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#_dictionary_links[in this section] of the
manual, though please start from the
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#templates[cards & templates] section as
the above link assumes you have read it.

Like the desktop, AnkiMobile supports links to dictionary websites. In
addition to that, you can also link to different dictionary apps that you have
installed on your device using a URL scheme.

Some dictionary apps provide a URL scheme that allows you to provide a
particular phrase to search for. For example, an app called iDict+ allows the
following type of URL:

  idictplus://?search=mysearchtext

If you have iDict+ installed and type that into Safari, iDict+ should open up
and immediately search for "mysearchtext".

iDict+ also supports passing a return link. We can replace the above with:

  idictplus://?search=txt&scheme=anki://

If you type that into Safari, it will search for "mysearchtext" like before,
but will also provide a "return" button that when pressed will open up Anki.

By taking that text and combining it with the instructions for the desktop
version linked above, it's possible to have a link on your cards that searches
for a word in another app, and then allows you to return to Anki when you're
done.

Unfortunately, there is no standard for URL schemes: some apps implement them,
some don't, and the way they implement them can different. For example, in the
app called "Kotoba!", the URL scheme is:

  kotoba://dictionary?word=mysearchtext

Note how not only the app name differs but also the text after it, and how
Kotoba! doesn't provide the ability to automatically return to the app that
opened it, meaning that you need to double tap the home button and manually
return to AnkiMobile.

Some dictionary apps publish their URL scheme in their documentation. If
you're using a dictionary app that doesn't, please contact the authors and ask
them for more information.

== MathJax ==

AnkiMobile supports MathJax out of the box. Simply place something like the
following on your card:

----
This is some text \(x^2\) with an inline equation.
----

----
An equation block:

\[\sqrt{-1}\]
----

== Javascript ==

The https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#javascript[warnings] that apply
to the computer version also apply to AnkiMobile.

In addition to the above, another thing to be aware of in AnkiMobile is that
your code also needs to play nicely with AnkiMobile's tap detection. Taps on
A/BUTTON elements, or elements that have an onclick handler should work as you
expect.

If you have other elements that must receive tap events, give them
the class 'tappable' to tell AnkiMobile 2.0.39 or later that it should pass taps
through to the element.

== Furigana ==

When combining the furigana/kanji/kana filters provided by the Japanese Support
add-on with cloze or hint fields, the cloze or hint fields must come second
in your template.

The following will work for example:

-----
{{furigana:cloze:Text}}
{{kanji:hint:HintField}}
-----

The following will not work in AnkiMobile before 2.0.39:

-----
{{cloze:Furigana:Text}}
-----

== Image Resizing ==

When you attach an image from the photo gallery it is automatically resized
to have a maximum length of 1024 along its longest edge.

As of 2.0.39, you can customize this limit. For example, to set it to 2048,
run the following in the computer version's
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#debug-console[debug console] then
sync to AnkiMobile:

-----
mw.col.conf["amImageMaxSize"] = 2048
mw.col.setMod()
mw.col.save()
-----

== Debug Log ==

If you're encountering a problem with Anki and we've asked you to provide
a debug log, please follow the following steps:

 . Connect your device via USB.
 . Open iTunes if it doesn't open automatically.
 . Locate Anki's file sharing section with
   http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4094[Apple's instructions].
 . Drag the debug.log file on to your desktop, then attach it to your support ticket.
