= Known issues with Anki 2.1 =

[[hwaccel]]
== Hardware acceleration and startup issues on Windows/Linux ==

Hardware acceleration defaults to off on Windows and Linux. Enabling it in
the preferences screen and restarting Anki may make Anki's interface more
responsive, but some users may experience missing menubars, blank windows
or crashes when it is enabled.

On Windows if you're unable to get to Anki's preferences screen and restarting
Anki a few times does not help, you may need to manually adjust the graphics
driver. You can do this by starting cmd.exe and typing the following:

  echo auto > %APPDATA%\Anki2\gldriver

There are three settings you can try 'auto', 'angle', and 'software'.

On Linux, you can write either 'auto' or 'software' into
~/.local/share/Anki2/gldriver to adjust the driver. Please note that if you're
using nouveau, it is known to be buggy and it only supports software mode.

== Interface speed ==

Even if you enable hardware acceleration as mentioned above, you may find
Anki takes longer to start and show new windows - especially if your computer
is not the fastest. This is caused by the use of a newer web toolkit, which
brings new features and security improvements, but is unfortunately more
resource intensive. The web toolkit older Anki versions use has been abandoned
at this point, so it is no longer an option for future releases.

== Shortcuts ==

The undo shortcut is different in the alternate version due to an issue
with the toolkit. You can discover the alternate shortcut by looking at the
Edit menu of the main screen.

On macOS, the alternate build does not support some shortcuts like
cmd+left/right when editing cards. Fn+left/right does work
instead. You can also use a third party tool like BetterTouchTool or Karabiner
to intercept the cmd+left/right keystroke when you type it into Anki, and
have it automatically be rewritten to use the function key instead.

== Copy & paste problems on Windows ==

If you are experiencing problems with copying and pasting on Windows, please
check if you are running other programs on your computer that monitor the clipboard,
such as dictionary programs, clipboard managers or clipping tools. The toolkit
Anki uses can have trouble when such programs are running.

== Fcitx on Linux ==

The standard Anki build includes fcitx support, but it may not work on all
distributions. If you are unable to use fcitx, you may want to run Anki from
source, or switch to a different input method.

== Text size ==

If you find the text is the wrong size, there are two environmental variables
you can try:

- ANKI_NOHIGHDPI=1 will turn off some of Qt's high dpi support
- ANKI_WEBSCALE=1 will alter the scale of Anki's web views (like the deck
list, study screen, etc), while leaving interface elements like the menu bar
alone. Replace 1 with the desired scale, such as 1.5 or 0.75.

On Windows you can add these to a batch file to make it easier to start Anki.
For example, create a file called startanki.bat on your desktop with the following
text:

  set ANKI_WEBSCALE=0.75
  start "Anki" "C:\Program Files\Anki\anki"

After saving, you can double click on the file to start Anki with that setting.

== SSL errors ==

Some work and school networks intercept your internet traffic, and this can
cause errors when syncing and downloading add-ons. You can prevent the errors
from occurring by setting the environmental variable "ANKI_NOVERIFYSSL" to "1".

When you enable this option, you are telling Anki not to verify that it is
actually talking with AnkiWeb. This means that not only your work or school,
but also a bad actor on the local network may be able to intercept your
syncing traffic.
